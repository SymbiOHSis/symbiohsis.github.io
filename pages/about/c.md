2900C is currently a two-man team, **Matthew Moran** and **Antony Faid**.
We also have **Ivan Merkulov**, a newbie who’s on holiday in Russia until August.

For *In the Zone* we have designed [Winston][1] the robot, who is more commonly
known as The Monstrosity. He (or it) focuses on cones and leaves
the mobile goal handling to our alliance partners.

We strive to do the best we can both on and off the field,
and uphold the [Kiwibots][2] value of “Gracious Professionalism” at all times.
