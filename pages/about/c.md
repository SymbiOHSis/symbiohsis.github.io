2900C is currently a two-man team, **Matthew Moran** and **Antony Faid**.

For *In the Zone* we are on our second revision of [Winston][1] the robot.
Winston V2 is an internal stacker that was designed around it's mobile goal intake.
We are consistantly in the top 5 (out of 35) in regional scrimmages.

We strive to do the best we can both on and off the field,
and uphold the [Kiwibots][2] value of “Gracious Professionalism” at all times.
