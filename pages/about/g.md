2900G (G for girls) is an all girls team with four members - Lesley Ly (year 12 driver), Zoe Forrest (year 12, back-up driver), Bonnie Holtom (year 12, engineer, team mascot) and Caitlyn Taylor (year 10, engineer).

SymbiOHSis’s first all-girls team works efficiently together and also knows how to have fun.

What makes 2900G unique from other teams is that all of us are newbies to robotics (some of us have only been around as long as middle of last season). This is one of 2900G’s biggest challenges so far, we have to learn and pick up on things quite quickly since we’re all new. But with help from mentors like Jess, this difficult challenge turns quickly into an interest rather than an obstacle.

We are the newest team in SymbiOHSis. So far, 2900G has done exceptionally well in this season. The season's second scrimmage was the first game that we participated in and we placed second in finals. Currently our robot can only lift mobile goals, but we’re currently working to improve our goal lift and in the future, design something that can lift cones.
