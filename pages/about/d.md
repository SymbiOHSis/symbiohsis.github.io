2900D consists of 3 students who study at Onehunga High School in Auckland.

Our team members are Rahul Bhati, Jordan Green, Shehaab Khan. The ages in our team vary from 14-17. Each of us enjoys the challenges we face in each new season and the amount of competition that we find in New Zealand.

We enjoy participating in all aspects of VEX Robotics and the associated challenges, while still having fun working together and supporting one other throughout the journey.
There is a lot of hard work involved with the countless hours spent in our robotics room, working off all the sweat on the robot.
